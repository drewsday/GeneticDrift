GeneticDrift
============

Genetic Drift simulation for intro biology courses.

Required:

Python, pylab (matplotlib, likely), Qt runtime libraries, numpy (likely)

Probably only the driftgui.pyc and the p_and_q_gui.py files are required to run the simulation.
The other files were for development purposes or output testing.
